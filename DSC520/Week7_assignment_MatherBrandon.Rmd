#You would use the covariance to measure either a positive linear relationship or a negative relationship. What I found using these equations is that the only one that has a positive relationship together is the time on the tv compared to happiness.

  #2)
head(survey_df)
#There seems to be two different variable types. There looks to be percentage (happiness) and hours (timereading and timetv). Gender is just a 0 or 1. One thing that could be improved is to make happiness, timereading and timetv all of the same type of variable, which would make the numbers more accurate.

#I chose the Pearson Correlation test to measure the strength of linear association between the two variables. This results in a negative correlation.

#The correlation between time reading and time on tv is a negative correlation and is closer to one then zero, which means they could have a negative relationship together.

# The correlation between time reading and happiness is normally -.0.4348663, when gender (controlling) is added it drops to -0.4277985  which doesn't make a huge change.
